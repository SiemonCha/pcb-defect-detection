# Quick Reference Guide

## New Features Added

### 1. ONNX Export (`export_onnx.py`)

**What it does**: Converts your trained PyTorch model to ONNX format, making it 3-5x faster

**Why it matters**: Industrial systems need fast inference. ONNX optimizes the model for production deployment.

**Usage**:

```bash
python export_onnx.py
# Auto-detects best model and benchmarks speed
```

**Output**:

- `best.onnx` - Optimized model
- `benchmark_results.txt` - Speed comparison report
- Console shows exact speedup (e.g., "4.2x faster")

**When to use**: After training, before deployment

---

### 2. Confusion Matrix Analysis (`confusion_matrix.py`)

**What it does**: Shows you exactly which defect types your model struggles with

**Why it matters**: Knowing your model's weaknesses lets you fix them (more data, better augmentation, etc.)

**Usage**:

```bash
python confusion_matrix.py
```

**Output**:

- `confusion_matrix.png` - Visual heatmap
- `performance_report.txt` - Detailed per-class metrics
- Identifies: Low recall (missed defects), Low precision (false alarms), Class imbalance

**Key metrics**:

- **Precision**: How many detections are correct (low = too many false alarms)
- **Recall**: How many actual defects found (low = missing defects)
- **F1**: Balance of precision and recall

**When to use**: After evaluation, to understand model performance

---

### 3. REST API (`api.py`)

**What it does**: Turns your model into a web service that other apps can use

**Why it matters**: Production systems need APIs. This is how you'd integrate into manufacturing lines.

**Usage**:

```bash
# Start server
python api.py

# Test it
python test_api.py
```

**Endpoints**:

- `POST /detect` - Upload image, get defects
- `GET /health` - Check if API is running
- `GET /model-info` - Get model details

**API docs**: Open http://localhost:8000/docs in browser for interactive testing

**When to use**: For demo or actual deployment

---

### 4. Transfer Learning (`transfer_learning.py`)

**What it does**: Fine-tunes your model on new PCB types with minimal data

**Why it matters**: Every factory has different PCBs. Transfer learning lets you adapt quickly with <100 images.

**Usage**:

```bash
python transfer_learning.py --data new_pcb/data.yaml --epochs 30
```

**Key parameters**:

- `--freeze 10` - Freezes backbone for first 10 epochs (prevents overfitting)
- `--lr 0.001` - Lower learning rate than training from scratch
- `--epochs 30-50` - Usually needs less epochs than full training

**When to use**: When you have a new PCB type or different lighting conditions

## Typical Workflow

### For Your Project Demo:

1. **Train**: `python train_baseline.py`
2. **Analyze**: `python confusion_matrix.py` (shows critical thinking)
3. **Optimize**: `python export_onnx.py` (shows deployment knowledge)
4. **Deploy**: `python api.py` (shows full-stack capability)

### For CV/Portfolio:

1. Show confusion matrix â†’ "I identified the model struggles with X defect"
2. Show ONNX speedup â†’ "Optimized inference by 4x for production"
3. Demo API â†’ "Deployed as REST API for integration"
4. Show transfer learning â†’ "Can adapt to new PCB types with minimal data"

- Applied transfer learning for domain adaptation
- Optimized with ONNX for real-time requirements

**Engineering Skills**:

- REST API for production deployment
- Proper error handling and validation
- Multi-platform GPU support

**Critical Thinking**:

## Common Questions

**Q: Which model should I use?**
A: YOLOv8n for demos (fast), YOLOv8s for accuracy claims

**Q: What's a good mAP@0.5 score?**
A: >80% is acceptable, >85% is good, >90% is excellent

**Q: Why use ONNX?**
A: Industrial systems need <100ms inference. ONNX gets you there.

**Q: What if confusion matrix shows problems?**
A: That's good! It shows you understand the model's limitations. Discuss in report.

**Q: Do I need all 4 features?**
A: No, but:

- **Minimum**: confusion_matrix + export_onnx (shows analysis + optimization)
- **Better**: Add api (shows deployment skills)
- **Best**: All 4 (shows complete ML engineering workflow)

## Tips

1. **Run confusion matrix first** - It tells you what to fix
2. **Export ONNX before API** - API can use either, but ONNX is faster
3. **Test API locally** - Use test_api.py before showing anyone
4. **Transfer learning last** - Only if you have time or different dataset

Good luck with your year 3 project! ðŸš€
